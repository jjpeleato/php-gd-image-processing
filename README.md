### Installing dependencies

- You have to install **Lando**: https://docs.devwithlando.io/

If Lando's tools does not work for you, there is another way. You must install the environment manually: XAMP, Composer, Node.JS, NPM or Yarn and Gulp CLI.

- XAMP: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html

- Node and NPM: https://nodejs.org/es/
- Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/es-ES/
- Gulp: https://gulpjs.com/

**Note:** If you work with Windows. To execute the commands, we recommend installing **Cygwin** http://www.cygwin.com/

**Note:** I recommend installing the following IDE for PHP Programming: Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or PHPStorm (recommended) (https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).

2. It is very important that if you deploy the project to publish with **Deployer**. The **DocumentRoot** on the VirtualHost has to point to the **current/public/** directory.

### Others clarifications
